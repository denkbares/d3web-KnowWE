[{TableOfContents  title='Abstraction Rules - TOC'}]

!! 1. Definition
Abstraction rules are rules, that initiate the automatical setting of certain answer values by the system, depending on answer values that were provided by the user for previous questions. Values that are to be set can either be derived from other question values or also from complex formulas (see C.).

!! 2. Syntax
!A. Setting a question's value
{{{IF numerical question  > 0
THEN "Average value?" = 20}}}
The above example presents a rule, that assigns the numerical value ''20'' to the (numerical) question ''Average value?'' in the case that rc1 is bigger than 0. 
{{{IF numerical question > 130
THEN choice question = increased}}}
Also the values of one-choice and multiple-choice questions are set just the same way, as shown right above. There, the one-choice question ''choice question'' is set to the value ''increased''.
\\

!B. Adding a value to a question's existing value
Analog to the setting of question values, values can also be added to the current value of numerical questions or additional choices can be made for multiple-choice questions. This is indicated by __+=__ in the rule action. The expression after __+=__ thereby always has to be listed in brackets. An example, where 2 is added to the value of the numerical question ''numquest'':
{{{IF (rule condition)
THEN numquest += ( 2 )}}}

!C. Complex expressions
The value of numeric abstraction questions (both for setting and adding of values, sections A. and B.) can be defined by  more complex expressions or formulas. 
{{{IF "Average mileage /100km" > 0 AND KNOWN["Real mileage  /100km"]
THEN "Num. Mileage evaluation" = (("Real mileage /100km" / "Average mileage/100km") * 100.0)}}}
In the above example, the value for the numerical question ''Num. Mileage evaluation'' is defined by a complex formula (which calculates the fraction of the ''Real mileage per 100km'' and the ''Average mileage per 100km'' and then mutliplies the resulting value by 100. Complex expressions like the above also always have to be defined inbetween brackets, as shown in the example.

\\
In general, complex expressions can be combined from basic elements listed in the subsequent table. Thereby symbols---as S1 and S2---can be the names of numerical questions; in that case, the answer value for that question is used for further calculations. Furthermore, symbols can be simple digits. Finally, symbols are also nestable, which is exemplarily shown in the above example where the expression is a product of a digit and a symbol, that itself is a fraction.
|| Element || Meaning
| ( S1 + S2 )	 | adds S1 and S2
| ( S1 - S2 )	 | subtracts S2 from S1
| ( S1 / S2 )	 | divides S1 by S2
| ( S1 * S2 )	 | multiplies S1 and S2
| ( S1 )	 | value of S1
