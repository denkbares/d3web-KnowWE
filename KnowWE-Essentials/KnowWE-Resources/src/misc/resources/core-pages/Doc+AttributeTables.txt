[{TableOfContents title='Attribute Tables - TOC'}]

!! 1. Definition
In KnowWE it is possible to extend certain objects by additional data. The definition of such data is done via AttributeTables. 

!! 2. Syntax
The syntax of AttributeTables is mostly inherited from wiki tables. Basically such a table describes more detailed attributes for knowledge-objects. The entry types of the table columns are as follows:
|IDObject | MMInfoSubject | DCElement {{{[Lang]}}} Title | Data
* __Column 1 - IDObject__: the name of the object for which the attribute is to be provided. In the example, both a question- (''Starter'') and a solution object (Flat battery) are shown.
* __Column 2 - MMInfoSubject__: the MMInfo type of the attribute; MMInfo types describe in particular the type of the attribute for the object defined in column 1. Possible MMInfo types are: \\
 ''__ - link__'' (links to other knowledge objects) \\
 ''__ - url__'' (for url objects) \\
 ''__ - media__'' (multi-media object to be shown in the dialog, e.g., dialog-picture) \\
 ''__ - multimedia__'' (arbitrary file type)\\
 ''__ - info__'' (a more detailed explanation of the object, as shown in the dialog) \\
 
 The actual attribute-data, extending the object, is then provided in column 4.
* __Column 3 - DCElement__: defines the ''Dublin Core'' markup for the object. For a description of ''__Dublin Core Metadata__'' see, e.g., [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core]  
* __Column 4 - Data__: the actual data that extends the given object. For the solution ''Flat battery'' in the example below, an additional description is provided.
Now a syntax example of a simple AttributeTable---that is, how such a table actually has to be entered into a KnowWE page---is shown:
{{{<AttributeTable-section>
| Starter | info | Model | New Modelinfo
| Flat battery | info | description | some more extensive description of a flat battery
</AttributeTable-section>}}}

!! 3. Rendering
Once included into a KnowWE page, an AttributeTable renders to:

%%prettify 
{{{
<AttributeTable-section>
| Starter | info | Model | New Modelinfo
| Flat battery | info | description | some flat battery description
</AttributeTable-section>
}}}
/%

!! 4. Quick Editing
AttributeTables also provide a ''quick editing'' feature. By clicking on the pen icon above the rendered table, the system automatically switches to quick editing mode, that is, the user can directly enter/modify the table entries via the provided textfields. The following screenshot shows a table that is rendered in quick editing mode:
[{Image src='Bild 1.png' width='100%' align='left|center|right'}]
As the image shows, the table fields are now rendered as textfields, that are directly editable by the user. If all changes/edits are done, the table is saved by simply clicking on the 'save' button.

Some more information on table definition/modification and quick editing is provided on the page __[Doc Tables| Doc Tables]__
