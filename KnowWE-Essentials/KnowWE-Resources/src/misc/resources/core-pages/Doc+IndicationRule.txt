[{TableOfContents title='Indication Rules - TOC'}]

!! 1. Definition
Indication rules basically initiate the presentation of certain, subsequent questions or questionnaires to the user depending on previously provided answers. Indications also can be defined dependent on an already derived solution. In general, indicated questionnaires/questions are added at the end of the current dialog-agenda (the current, still-to-pose questionnaires/questions). However, there also exist ''instant indication rules'' in KnowWE, which present the indicated questionnaires/questions instantly after the current question.

!! 2. Syntax - Basic indication rules
!A. Indication of one questionnaire/question
{{{IF someQuestion = answerValue
THEN specialQuestions}}}
In this example, the questionnaire ''specialQuestions'' is added at the end of the dialog-agenda if the question ''someQuestion'' has been answered with ''answerValue''.

!B. Indication of multiple questionnaires/questions
{{{IF diag = diagState
THEN questionnaire1; questionnaire2}}}
The above example shows that multiple questionnaires/questions for a gradual indication are simply separated by semicolons. It also presents the solution-dependent indication: if the diagnosis ''diag'' has the diagnosis state ''diagState'' (see [Doc DiagnosisRule] for a listing of scoring and diagnosis states) the questionnaires ''questionnaire1'' and ''questionnaire2'' are gradually indicated.

!C. Checking for answers
{{{IF KNOWN[quest]
THEN specialQuestion}}}
If a question/questionnaire should be indicated independet of the concrete answer value but depending just on that any answer value was provided, the ''KNOWN'' keyword is to be used. The example shows how to check, whether question ''quest'' has already been answered. The question that has to be checked must be placed within square brackets. 


!! 3. Syntax - Instant indication rules
If an indicated question/questionnaire is to be presented instantly after the current question, so-called ''instant indication rules'' have to be used. 
{{{IF q1 = yes
THEN INSTANT [questionInstant]}}}
In the following example ''questionInstant'' is presented instantly after the current question, if the question ''q1'' is answered with ''yes'' - further questionnqires may be added by additionally listing them in square brackets, separated by semicolons (e.g. [[qs1; qs2]).

Regarding start questionnaires, however, instant indications don't intervene the order there. Start questionnaires are always presented first.
