KnowWE.SeleniumTest.Damaged = !!! Damaged idle speed system\nadapted from Wikipedia\n\n[{TableOfContents }]\n\n!! General\n----\nIdle speed is the minimum operating speed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft) of a combustion engine. \n\nAt idle speed, the engine generates enough power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile. \n\nFor a passenger-car engine, idle speed is customarily between 600 rpm and 1,000 rpm.\n\n!! Typical Symptoms\n----\n\nFrequent symptoms which occur if the idle speed system is damaged are a barely starting engine as well as a low or unsteady idle speed.\n\n!! Repair Instructions\n----\nIn most cases a problem with the idle speed system can easily fixed by raising the idle speed. This will ensure that the engine generates enough power to run smoothly and operate the accessories. \n\nIn particular this is necessary if the engine is operating a large number of energy-hungry accessories such as air conditining. \n\nDue to most newer engines and especially air conditioning-equipped engines have an automatic adjust feature the idle speed can only be adjusted with a computer system. This computer system is available in almost every garage.\n\nIn some cases it is also helpfel to clean the intake system.  \n\n<Kopic>\n<Solutions-section>\nDamaged idle speed system\n</Solutions-section>\n\n<Rules-section>\nIF \"Idle speed system o.k.?\" = yes\nTHEN Damaged idle speed system = N7\n\nIF \"Idle speed system o.k.?\" = no\nTHEN Damaged idle speed system = P7\n\nIF NOT (Engine start = engine barely starts)\nTHEN Damaged idle speed system = N5\n\nIF Engine start = engine barely starts\nTHEN Damaged idle speed system = P5\n\nIF NOT (Driving = unsteady idle speed) \nTHEN Damaged idle speed system = N1\n\nIF Driving = unsteady idle speed\nTHEN Damaged idle speed system = P1\n\nIF NOT (Driving = low idle speed) \nTHEN Damaged idle speed system = N4\n\nIF Driving = low idle speed\nTHEN Damaged idle speed system = P4\n</Rules-section>\n\n<include src=\"Car-Diagnosis-Test/QuestionsSection\"/>\n\n\n</Kopic>\n\n\n
KnowWE.SeleniumTest.Leaking = !!! Leaking air intake system\nadapted from Wikipedia\n\n[{TableOfContents}]\n\n!! General\n----\n\nA (cold) air intake is a device used to bring lower temperature air into a car's internal-combustion engine, to increase engine power and efficiency. \n\nIt also enhances efficiency through higher flow, and can increase the life of the engine by allowing it to run cooler.\n\n!! Typical Symptoms\n----\n\nA Leaking air intake system can cause symptoms like insufficient power on full or partial load. Additionaly it can be the reason for an unsteady idle speed or increased mileage.\n\n!!

At this point it is highly recommended to check if there are better/custom air intakes which offer an increased engine power and efficiency than the standard/factory air intake. \n\nAfterwards a new air filter has to be installed by attaching it to the air intake pipe. The new air filter should always be checked that it is preoiled and not damaged. \n\nFinally the new air intake can be installed.\n\n\n<Kopic>\n\n<Solutions-section>\nLeaking air intake system\n</Solutions-section>\n\n<Rules-section>\nIF NOT (Driving = insufficient power on partial load OR Driving = unsteady idle speed OR Driving = insufficient power on full load)\nTHEN Leaking air intake system = N3\n\nIF Driving = insufficient power on full load\nTHEN Leaking air intake system = P5\n\nIF Driving = insufficient power on partial load\nTHEN Leaking air intake system = P3\n\nIF Driving = unsteady idle speed\nTHEN Leaking air intake system = P1\n\nIF Mileage evaluation = slightly increased\nTHEN Leaking air intake system = P3\n\nIF Mileage evaluation = normal\nTHEN Leaking air intake system = N4\n\nIF Mileage evaluation = increased\nTHEN Leaking air intake system = P4\n\nIF \"Air intake system o.k.?\" = yes\nTHEN Leaking air intake system = N7\n\nIF \"Air intake system o.k.?\" = no\nTHEN Leaking air intake system = P7\n</Rules-section>\n\n<include src=\"Car-Diagnosis-Test/QuestionsSection\"/>\n</Kopic>\n

General\n----\n[{Image src='air-filter-1.JPG' width='180' height='135' align='right' style='border: solid 1px' caption='clogged air filter' }]\n\nThe (combustion) air filter prevents abrasive particulate matter from entering the engine's cylinders, where it would cause mechanical wear and oil contamination.\n\nMost fuel injected vehicles use a pleated paper filter element in the form of a flat panel. This filter is usually placed inside a plastic box connected to the throttle body with an intake tube.\n\nOlder vehicles that use carburetors or throttle body fuel injection typically use a cylindrical air filter, usually a few inches high and between 6 and 16 inches in diameter. This is positioned above the carburetor or throttle body, usually in a metal or plastic container which may incorporate ducting to provide cool and/or warm inlet air, and secured with a metal or plastic lid.\n\n!! Typical Symptoms\n----\n\nTypical symptoms, which indicate a clogged air filter, are the following {{driving issues:  <=> asks:: Driving}} unsteady idle speed, weak acceleration, starting problems, increased mileage (based on {{average mileage <=> asks::  Average mileage /100km }} and {{the currently measured mileage <=> asks:: Real mileage  /100km}}  or abnormal exhaust fumes. \n\n\n__Comment:__ ''This rule should be moved to somewhere else''\n{{{\nIF (Exhaust fumes = black AND Fuel = unleaded gasoline)\nTHEN Clogged air filter = Suggested\n}}}\n\nA typical {{starting problem <=> explains:: Engine start = does not start}} which is connected to this problem is a barely or not {{starting engine <=> asks:: Engine start}} in combination with a {{starter <=> asks:: Starter}} that turns over.\n\nA clogged air filter can cause black exhaust fumes which will turn the color of the exhaust pipe to sooty black.\n\n__Relevant symptoms__:\n* engine start\n* exhaust fume color\n* driving\n* real mileage \n\n<Table default=\"+,-,0\" column=\"1\" row=\"1\">\n| | Clogged Air Filter\n| Driving : unsteady idle speed |    + \n| Driving : weak acceleration |    + \n| Starter : turns over |-\n| Exhaust pipe color evaluation : abnormal |0\n| Exhaust fumes : black |    +\n</Table>\n\n__Comment:__ ''The table above needs some verification''\n\n\n{{{\nIF NOT (Driving = weak acceleration)\nTHEN Clogged air filter = Excluded\n}}}\n\n\n!!

Therefore the air filter housing have to be found. It will be either square (on fuel-injected engines) or round (on older carbureted engines) and about 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter. \n\nAfter locating the housing the screws or clambs on the top of it have to be removed. Now the old air filter can be removed. At this point the housing should be cleaned from any dirt and debris with a clean rag.\n\nFinally the new air filter can be put in and the top of the housing can be screwed or clambed back on. \n\n<Kopic>\n<Rules-section>\nIF Driving = unsteady idle speed\nTHEN Clogged air filter = P4\n\nIF Driving = weak acceleration\nTHEN Clogged air filter = P5\n\nIF NOT (Exhaust fumes = black)\nTHEN Clogged air filter = N5\n\nIF \"Air filter o.k.?\" = yes\nTHEN Clogged air filter = N7\n\nIF \"Air filter o.k.?\" = no\nTHEN Clogged air filter = P7\n\nIF NOT (Driving = unsteady idle speed OR Driving = weak acceleration)\nTHEN Clogged air filter = N5\n\nIF NOT (Starter = turns over) \nTHEN Clogged air filter = N6\n\nIF Exhaust pipe color evaluation = abnormal\nTHEN Clogged air filter = P5\n\nIF Exhaust pipe color evaluation = normal\nTHEN Clogged air filter = N5\n\nIF (Exhaust fumes = black AND Fuel = unleaded gasoline)\nTHEN Clogged air filter = P5\n\nIF Mileage evaluation = slightly increased\nTHEN Clogged air filter = P3\n\nIF Mileage evaluation = normal\nTHEN Clogged air filter = N4\n\nIF Mileage evaluation = increased\nTHEN Clogged air filter = P4\n\nIF NOT ((Engine start = does not start OR Engine start = engine barely starts)) \nTHEN Clogged air filter = N4\n\nIF ((Engine start = does not start OR Engine start = engine barely starts) AND Starter = turns over)\nTHEN Clogged air filter = P4\n</Rules-section>\n\n<include src=\"Car-Diagnosis-Test/QuestionsSection\"/>\n\n\n<Solutions-section>\nClogged air filter\n</Solutions-section>\n\n</Kopic>\n
KnowWE.SeleniumTest.Bad = !!! Bad ignition timing\nadapted from Wikipedia\n\n[{TableOfContents }]\n\n!! General\n----\n\n[Ignition timing <=> subClassOf:: TechnicalProblem], is the process of setting the time that a spark will occur in the combustion chamber (during the power stroke) relative to piston position and crankshaft angular velocity.\n\nSetting the correct ignition timing is crucial in the performance of an engine. The ignition timing affects many variables including engine longevity, fuel economy, and engine power. \n\n!! Typical Symptoms\n----\n\nBad ignition timing can have multiple symptoms: For example, some {{starting problems <=> asks:: Starter}}  are related to bad ignition timing. So a bad ignition timing can results in a barely or not starting engine. \nAdditionally, bad ignition timing can be the reason for {{performance problems <=> asks:: Driving}} such as delayed take-off or weak acceleration. \nFurthermore, bad ignition timing frequently causes {{engine noises <=> asks:: Engine noises}} such as ringing or knocking.\n\n!! Repair Instructions\n----\n\nSetting the ignition timing while monitoring engine power output with a dynamometer is one way to correctly set the ignition timing. After advancing or retarding the timing, a corresponding change in power output will usually occur. A load type dynamometer is the best way to accomplish this as the engine can be held at a steady speed and load while the timing is adjusted for maximum output.\n\nPlease note that newer engines typically use electronic ignition systems (ignition controlled by a computer). Most computers from original equipment manufacturers (OEM) are not able to be modified so changing the timing is not possible. \n\nOverall timing changes are still possible, depending on the engine design. Aftermarket engine control units allow to make changes to the timing map. This allows the timing to be advanced or retarded based on various engine applications.\n\n<Kopic>\n<Solutions-section>\nBad ignition timing\n</Solutions-section>\n\n<Rules-section>\nIF NOT ((Engine start = does not start OR Engine start = engine barely starts)) \nTHEN Bad ignition timing = N5\n\nIF (Engine noises = ringing OR Engine noises = knocking)\nTHEN Bad ignition timing = P5\n\nIF NOT ((Engine noises = ringing OR Engine noises = knocking)) \nTHEN Bad ignition timing = N3\n\nIF ((Engine start = does not start OR Engine start = engine barely starts) AND Starter = turns over)\nTHEN Bad ignition timing = P5\n\nIF NOT (Driving = \"delayed take-off\" OR Driving = unsteady idle speed OR Driving = weak acceleration)\nTHEN Bad ignition timing = N4\n\nIF Driving = unsteady idle speed\nTHEN Bad ignition timing = P1\n\nIF Driving = \"delayed take-off\"\nTHEN Bad ignition timing = P3\n\nIF Driving = weak acceleration\nTHEN Bad ignition timing = P4\n\nIF NOT (Starter = turns over) \nTHEN Bad ignition timing = N6\n\nIF \"Ignition timing o.k.?\" = yes\nTHEN Bad ignition timing = N7\n\nIF \"Ignition timing o.k.?\" = no\nTHEN Bad ignition timing = P7\n\n\n</Rules-section>\n\n<include src=\"Car-Diagnosis-Test/QuestionsSection\"/>\n\n</Kopic>\n

General\n----\n\nA car battery is a type of rechargeable battery that supplies electric energy to an automobile. Usually this refers to an SLI battery (starting, lighting, ignition) to power the starter motor, the lights, and the ignition system of a vehicle's engine.\n\n!! Typical Symptoms\n----\n\nTypical symptoms for an empty battery are an engine that does not or barely starts or a startet that does not turn over.\n\n!! Repair Instructions\n----\n[{Image src='jumpercable.jpg' width='180' height='202' align='right' style='border: solid 1px' caption='jumpercable' }]\n\nIn emergencies a battery can be jump started, by the battery of another vehicle or by a hand portable battery booster. Generally, this is not recommended on newer, computer-controlled vehicles as damage can easily occur.\n\nTo jump start a battery the hoods of both cars need to be open. The car that provides the jump should turned off. Now one end of the jumper cables have to be clamped onto the car battary of the car providing the jump. The positive (or red) clamp should be connected to the positive(or red) battery post first. Afterwards the negative (or black) clamp can be conntected to the negative (or black) post of the battery. \n\nNow the other end of the cables can be connected to the other car's battery by installing the positive clamp onto the positive post of the dead battery. The negative clamp should be connect to a clean ground on the engine of the dead car or directly onto the negative battery post.\n\nNow the car that is doing the jumping have to be started - now the charging beginns. After 5 - 10 minutes turn off the engine of the car that provides the jump. \n\nAfterwards the dead car should start again. If so you can remove the cables in the opposite order you connected them (negative before positive - former dead car before providing car).
