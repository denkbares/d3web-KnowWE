This article will be tested against a manually created KnowledgeBase.
If you want to edit this article do also apply your changes to
the KBCreationTestUtil class where the manually created KnowledgeBase
is assembled. Otherwise the tests will fail!

Please be careful when editing this article because the order
of the elements does matter in the tests (especially the IDs).
