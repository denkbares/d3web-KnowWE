build_20090513_1345 astriffler
	* replaced hotfix in PartOfIDObjectStrategy with an
	actual fix

build_20090428_1240 JoeD
	* catch Nullpointer when synonyms are null

build_20090220_0905 astriffler
	* catched PatternSyntaxException in PartOfIDObjectStrategy 

build_20090212_1715 reutelshoefer
	* removed project d3web-SCM
	
build_20081107_1800 reutelshoefer
	* added some Null-checks
	* change return type of extraction from Set to TreeSet

build_20080915_2320 frese
	* reworked "CrossComparisonStrategy: Achieved a significant perfomance
	  gain by using a HashMap for data which was calculated over and over
	  in the past.

build_20080915_1600 frese
	* reworked "OriginalMatchAndStrategy":
		* removed the offset variable because it was obsolete
		* fixed the sometimes erroneous rating calculation
		* expanded the toString-method
	
	* reworked "QuestionAndAnswerWithRating":
		* fixed the erroneouscompareTo-method
		* added a toString-method
		
	* reworked "TiRexInterpreter":
		* added two methods that allow to extract several answers and questions
		  from a line of knowledge
		* reworked the method "extractQuestionsAndAnswers" based on the two new
		  method.
		  "extractQuestionsAndAnswers" is the method that should be first choice
		  when it comes to extracting knowledge now. It is used in the TiRexModule
		  of KnowWe2 as well.
	
	* reworked TiRexSettings (removed some useless overhead I generated in the last
	  patch)
	  
	* added minor fixes to every single Extraction Stratgy as they were not working
	  as intended at times.

	* added simple logger class (TiRexLogger) to ease debugging when working in the
	  JSPWiki environment. It served its purpose well ;)
	  
	* Added a new ExtractionStrategy: "PartOfIDObjectStrategy"
	
	* TODO: Some parts of the code are still poorly commented, that should be fixed
	  in the near future

build_20080819_1120 frese
	* Added a rating system to OriginalMatchAndStrategy which helps to evaluate the
	  quality of the match that TiRex found
	* Added an additional Extraction Strategy: "CrossComparisonStrategy"
	  Warning! It's only a temporary version of the strategy most likely, since it's
	  not properly tested yet.

build_20080729_1715 reutelshoefer
	* added null check to AbstractExtractionStrategy

build_20080530_1430 lemmerich
	* corrected RegExPattern in TiRexInterpreter to solve a StackOverflow problem 

build_20080530_1030 lemmerich
	* Hotfixed a bug (NullPointerException) when synonymsmap is missing in TiRexSettings. Final solution still to be done.

build_20080524_1625 haupt
	* changed encoding of ressourcefiles from iso-8859-1 to utf-8
	* if tirex-settings,-config,-convregex topic don't exist in the wiki, defaults are now 
	  loaded from ressourefiles, instead of dying with nullpointerexception
	  
build_20080517_1745 reutelshoefer
	* Settings can be initialized with preloaded config-Strings (from Wikicontext)

build_20080517_1715 reutelshoefer
	* Conversion of CondNums to KnOffice-Syntax - last group replaced by "" (deleted)

build_20080516_1800 reutelshoefer
	* some small changes for provisory integration of TiRex in KnowWE2

build_20080225_1555 frese
	* initial version of TiRex
	
build_20080229_1100 frese
	* significantly restructured TiRex:
		* removed lots of obsolete methods
		* merged some methods and removed quite some redundant code
		* synonym sets are saved in an extra file now
		* The files that are necessary to run the TiRexInterpreter 
		  are saved in the TiRexFileReader now
		* Added an interface "ExtractionStrategy" and an abstract class
		  "AbstractExtractionStrategy" along with 5 different Strategies
		  (direct match, edit distance match, synonym match, synonym with edit
		  distance, numerical regexes). These strategies can be used in any
		  desired composition to analyze a piece of text and extract knowledge.
	    * reworked the OriginalMatchAndProbability class - it is called 
		  OriginalMatchAndStrategy now and saves the IDObject, that belongs
		  to the match as well as the strategy that the match was found with
	* reworked the javadoc of some of the classes, and documented all of
	  the new classes (the javadoc is complete now, except the getters and
	  setters, the constructors and the TiRexPanel, which is pretty much
	  self explanatory).
	* Implemented an ExtractionStrategy based on Stemming ("StemmingMatch")
	  I fervently hope that all our fans of stemming are satisfied now ;-)
	  
build_20080313_1600 frese
	* Changed the shape of the synonym files once more. Every set of synonyms is
	  represented as follows now:
	  concept = notion 1, notion 2, notion 3, ...
	  where "concept" is the identifier of the synonym set and should be an exact
	  match of the question or answer text that the synonyms are listed for.
	  "notion x" are the synonyms of the "concept".
	* Modified some of the Extraction Strategies
	* Modified the output format of the extracted knowledge
	
build_20080320_1420 frese
	* The TiRexInterpreter is able to recognize and extract several knowledgeblocks
	  within a textpage (it was limited to one block before)
	* The settings for TiRex are no longer saved in a ResourceBundle, but instead in
	  an extra file.
	* Added a folder with all the necessary libraries
	* Restructured The TiRexFileReader, the files are saved as Strings now, with the
	  exception of the knowledgebase
	* This build is a "hotfix", because people need the "libraries" folder immediately.
	  Currently there is a bug in "TiRexPanel" preventing it from starting properly
	  - it will be addressed asap.
