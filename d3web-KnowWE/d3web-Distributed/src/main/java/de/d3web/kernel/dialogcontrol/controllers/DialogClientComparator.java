	 * Compares its two arguments for order. Returns a negative integer, zero,
	 * or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or
	 * greater than the second.
	 * <p>
	 * 
	 * The implementor must ensure that <tt>sgn(compare(x, y)) ==
	 * -sgn(compare(y, x))</tt> for all <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>. (This implies
	 * that <tt>compare(x, y)</tt> must throw an exception if and only if
	 * <tt>compare(y, x)</tt> throws an exception.)
	 * <p>
	 * 
	 * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
	 * <tt>((compare(x, y)&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (compare(y, z)&gt;0))</tt> implies
	 * <tt>compare(x, z)&gt;0</tt>.
	 * <p>
	 * 
	 * Finally, the implementer must ensure that <tt>compare(x, y)==0</tt>
	 * implies that <tt>sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z))</tt> for all
	 * <tt>z</tt>.
	 * <p>
	 * 
	 * It is generally the case, but <i>not</i> strictly required that
	 * <tt>(compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y))</tt>. Generally speaking, any
	 * comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate this
	 * fact. The recommended language is "Note: this comparator imposes
	 * orderings that are inconsistent with equals."
	 * 
	 * @return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first
	 *         argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
